DevOps Coding Challenge
=======================

We asked our junior developer to write a program to read from two
web services and report on the status of all the feature branches.

He made a good start, but decided to leave before finishing his work.
Please take a look at his code and finish up anything you see that
needs work.

To complete this challenge:

* Obtain a machine with java 8+ and maven 3+ installed.
* Create a github account if you do not already have one.
* Clone this repository.
* Make changes to the source files.  Keep an eye out for bugs and fix them,
and optimizations you can make and make them.  We expect all unit tests to pass.
* Commit your changes, push to your repository, and create a pull request.
* You should feel free to do a code review!  State why you did things the way you
did, how you would improve the code if you had more time, etc.  We love good ideas,
so let's hear them.

Notes
=====
Expect that the buildStatuses and featureBranches are pretty rigid, i.e. no changing these files to fit
your unit tests!
